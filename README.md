# RAG-Based QA Bot

This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to creating a question-answering (QA) bot. The bot leverages ChromaDB for storing and retrieving information, combined with Hugging Face Transformers models to generate accurate and context-aware answers.

## Introduction

The RAG-based QA bot allows users to ask natural language questions and receive informative answers, utilizing a hybrid of retrieval and generative techniques. The bot retrieves relevant context from a ChromaDB vector database, and then generates answers using a transformer-based language model from Hugging Face.

This project demonstrates how to integrate both retrieval and generation pipelines to build a more accurate and dynamic QA bot.

## Features

- **Contextual Answers**: Uses ChromaDB to store knowledge in vector embeddings, allowing for context-based retrieval and improved answer accuracy.
- **Transformers Model**: Utilizes state-of-the-art language models from Hugging Face for answer generation.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable with new data and different models from Hugging Face.
- **Efficient**: Combines retrieval and generation for fast and scalable QA.

## Technologies Used

- **ChromaDB**: A vector database for storing and searching embeddings, enabling fast context retrieval.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Pretrained transformer models for generating high-quality answers.
- **Python**: Core language for building the project.
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow**: Frameworks for working with the Hugging Face models.
- **faiss**: A library for efficient similarity search, integrated with ChromaDB for fast vector retrieval.
